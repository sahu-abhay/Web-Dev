        Now is the winter of our discontent Made glorious summer by this sun of
        York; And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house In the deep bosom of

        meetings, Our dreadful marches to delightful measures. Grim-visaged war
        hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;

      made to court an amorous looking-glass; I, that am rudely stamp'd, and
      want love's majesty To strut before a wanton ambling nymph; I, that am
      curtail'd of this fair proportion,
